Are you confused between Collection, Collection Interface, Collections Class, Collection Framework?

Collection: A group of individual objects that represent a single entity is known as a collection.
It is the common word that you used in your daily life. But if we are discussing Java programming language then it will
become Java Collection Framework.

Collection Framework: To represent a group of objects as a single entity in the Java programming language we need
classes and interfaces defined by the Collection Framework. If are from C++ background that you can compare Collection
with Containers and Collection Framework with STL(Standard Template Library).

Collection Interface: Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class. It is the
root interface of the Collection Framework that defines the most common methods that can be used for any collection
objects. Or you can say it represents the individual object as a single entity.

Collections Class: It is present in java.util package and is a member of Collection Framework. This class provides many
utility methods for the collection object.

Three Main Advantages:
1. Reduces the programming effort as the programmer does not have to worry about designing the Collection class and on
the same hand java being object-oriented language advances in achieving abstraction by not writing the Collection class.

2. Increases program speed and quality as the programmer now is not worried about thinking best implementation for a
specific data structure as of now for a programmer scope widens up and at the same time is now only worried about the
best implementation that can drastically boost the performance of program irrespective of data structure constraints
encountered earlier.

3. The API that implements these interfaces are now having common sets of methods be it of any interfaces such as
Collection, Set, List, and Map.
