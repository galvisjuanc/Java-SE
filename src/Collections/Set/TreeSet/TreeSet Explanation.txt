TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage.
The ordering of the elements is maintained by a set using their natural ordering whether or not an explicit comparator
is provided. This must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the Set interface.

It can also be ordered by a Comparator provided at set creation time, depending on which constructor is used.
The TreeSet implements a NavigableSet interface by inheriting AbstractSet class.
