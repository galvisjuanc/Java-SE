Enumerations or popularly known as enum serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming
language. For example, the 4 suits in a deck of playing cards may be 4 enumerators named Club, Diamond, Heart, and Spade,
belonging to an enumerated type named Suit.

The EnumSet is one of the specialized implementations of the Set interface for use with the enumeration type.
A few important features of EnumSet are as follows:

1. It extends AbstractSet class and implements Set Interface in Java.
2. EnumSet class is a member of the Java Collections Framework & is not synchronized.
3. It’s a high-performance set implementation, much faster than HashSet.
4. All of the elements in an EnumSet must come from a single enumeration type that is specified when the set is created
either explicitly or implicitly.
5. It does not allow null Objects and throws NullPointerException if we do so.
6. It uses a fail-safe iterator, so it won’t throw ConcurrentModificationException if the collection is modified while
iterating.
