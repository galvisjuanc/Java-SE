Java HashSet class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table which is actually a HashMap instance.
No guarantee is made as to the iteration order of the hash sets which means that the class does not guarantee the
constant order of elements over time. This class permits the null element. The class also offers constant time
performance for the basic operations like add, remove, contains, and size assuming the hash function disperses
the elements properly among the buckets, which we shall see further in the article.

Java HashSet Features
A few important features of HashSet are mentioned below:

Implements Set Interface.
The underlying data structure for HashSet is Hashtable.
As it implements the Set Interface, duplicate values are not allowed.
Objects that you insert in HashSet are not guaranteed to be inserted in the same order. Objects are inserted based on
their hash code.
NULL elements are allowed in HashSet.
HashSet also implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
