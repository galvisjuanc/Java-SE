/**
 * Binary search is one of the most popular algorithms This class represents
 * iterative version {@link BinarySearch} Iterative binary search is likely to
 * have lower constant factors because it doesn't involve the overhead of
 * manipulating the call stack. But in java the recursive version can be
 * optimized by the compiler to this version.

 * Worst-case performance O(log n) Best-case performance O(1) Average
 * performance O(log n) Worst-case space complexity O(1)
