Jump Search

Like Binary Search, Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer elements
(than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.
For example, suppose we have an array arr[] of size n and a block (to be jumped) of size m. Then we search in the indexes
arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m]…..arr[km] and so on. Once we find the interval (arr[km] < x < arr[(k+1)m]), we perform a linear
search operation from the index km to find the element x.

Let’s consider the following array: (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610). The length of the array
is 16. The Jump search will find the value of 55 with the following steps assuming that the block size to be jumped is 4.gi
